As a developer, I want smart commits which allow me to automatically resolve tickets (a la Jira)
As a team member, I want trello cards to have their own chat channel and chat log.
As a manager, I want time keeping integration for cards to keep track of work flow.
As a developer, I want to be able to submit a blocker and automatically have a chat channel available for resolutions.
As a team leader, I want notifications anytime a blocker is sent with the option to be notified by email.
